It details the selection process for the AI API from Google Gemini and its integration, providing enhanced translation accuracy for real-time livestream content.

## Selecting the AI API from Google Gemini

After evaluating several APIs for real-time text translation, the AI API from Google Gemini was selected for its superior translation accuracy and contextual understanding capabilities. The decision was based on comprehensive testing and comparison of translation quality across different languages and contexts.

## Integration Steps

1. **API Setup**: Register for the Google Gemini API and obtain the necessary API keys.
2. **Extension Configuration**: Update the streaming-translated-extension project to include the Google Gemini API keys in its configuration.
3. **Transcription and Translation**: Implement functionality to transcribe the livestream audio in real-time and pass the transcription to the Google Gemini API for translation.
4. **Display Translated Text**: Integrate the translated text into the livestream, displaying it to viewers in real-time.

## API Calls and Responses

### Example API Call

```json
{
  "q": "Hello, world!",
  "source": "en",
  "target": "es",
  "format": "text"
}
```

### Example API Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "translations": [
      {
